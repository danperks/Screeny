# Screeny

A taskbar screenshot tool built in Python, with OCR and Imgur Upload

## Installation

- Install the required modules with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Install PyTesseract to the default directory: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
- Add that directory to the Path enviromental variables
- Run the program, and check the Notification Icons

## Usage

To use the program regularly, just run Screeny.py and everything should work fine.
Let me know with a Issue if you find an issue.


### Keybinds

To use keybinds, edit them in the last few lines of the code.
The only default bind is 'Shift + S', which will run the screenshot tool and search its text
